# FourLLIE: Boosting Low-Light Image Enhancement by Fourier Frequency Information

## Introduction

This is the official pytorch implementation of "FourLLIE: Boosting Low-Light Image Enhancement by Fourier Frequency Information" **(ACM MM 2023)**

![pipeline](https://github.com/wangchx67/FourLLIE/blob/main/figs/pipeline.png)

We design a two-stage framework to enhance low-light images with the help of the Fourier frequency information. In the first stage, we improve the lightness of low-light images by estimating the amplitude transform map in the Fourier space. In the second stage, we introduce the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) map to provide the prior for integrating the global Fourier frequency and the local spatial information, which recovers image details in the spatial space. With this ingenious design, FourLLIE outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLIE methods on four representative datasets while maintaining good model efficiency. 

## Installation

```
conda create --name FourLLIE --file requirements.txt
conda activate FourLLIE
```

## Train

You can modify the training configuration (e.g., the path of datasets, learning rate, or model settings) in `./options/train/LOLv2_real.yml` and run:

```
python train.py -opt ./options/train/LOLv2_real.yml
```

## Test

Modify the testing configuration in `./options/test/LOLv2_real.yml` and run:

```
python test.py -opt ./options/test/LOLv2_real.yml
```

## Datasets

- LOL-real and LOL-sys can be found in [here](https://github.com/flyywh/SGM-Low-Light).
- LSRW-Huawei and LSRW-Nikon can be found in [here](https://github.com/JianghaiSCU/R2RNet).
