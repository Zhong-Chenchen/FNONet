# FNONet:Boosting Low-Light Image Enhancement by Fourier Neural Operator
## Introduction
This is the official pytorch implementation of "FNONet:Boosting Low-Light Image Enhancement by Fourier Neural Operator" by **Zhongchen**.


Compared to natural scenes with ample illumination, images captured in low-light conditions typically suffer from deficiencies such as underexposure, low contrast, color inaccuracies and limited dynamic range. To enhance the perceptual quality of image in low-light environments, we addresses the limitations of capturing long-range image dependencies in existing methods, assessing the influence of different color space on low-light image enhancement. In this study, we propose FNONet, a two-stage enhancement model that leverages the YCbCr color space and feature fusion.
